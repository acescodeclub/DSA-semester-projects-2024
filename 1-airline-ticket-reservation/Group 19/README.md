## Introduction

This project is a demonstration of how linked lists can be utilized to implement an efficient and flexible airline ticket reservation system. Linked lists are dynamic data structures that allow for easy insertion and deletion of elements, making them ideal for scenarios where the size of the data may vary.

## Features

- **Reservation System:** Passengers can reserve tickets, cancel reservations, check existing reservations, and display the list of passengers.
- **Linked List Operations:** In addition to the reservation system, standard linked list operations such as inserting nodes, deleting nodes, and traversing the list to display its contents are implemented.

## Usage

To run the Airline Ticket Reservation System, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `main.py` script using `streamlit run main.py`.
4. Use the sidebar to select the desired operation (Reserve a ticket, Cancel a reservation, Check reservations, Display passengers).
5. Follow the prompts and input needed information as prompted.

## Code Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `main.py`: Contains the main Streamlit application code for interacting with the reservation system.
- `airline_reservation.py`: Defines the `AirlineReservation` class for the reservation system.
- `utils.py`: Contains utility functions used in the project.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the dependencies required to run the project.
